#Twitch Interface

[PHP] Twitch Interface

This is a universal PHP interface designed specifically to connect to and interact with the twitch.tv Kraken API servers.  It was designed with the intention of being very controlled, safe and light for both the user server and the Kraken API servers.  Almost, if not all capable calls are coded directly into the interface, allowing the interface to perform almost, if not all functions that the API allows.  Any functions that you believe need to be added or improved can be done via a pull request or opening up an issue.

Currently this interface supports all V3 API calls.

# News

<code>10-13-2015:</code> Well...It has been a long while since I did anything on this repo.  Anyone who knows me will know this, but I think it is time it is written somewhere so no one thinks this is entirely abandoned.  Last year In November I got a full time job and that has been eating a good 80% of my time.  The reamining time I have spent with either the people I care about or my latest project, which will be a complete CMS build of my own site for fun (Anyone who knows how to go about what I'm doing know that it is a frustratingly slow build, but still a blast to build a CMS from the ground up.  The only thing I won't be building is the template language and any service addons like Google ReCAPTCHA).  Once I get my site to a point where it actually does something more than create a naked session and allow you to see a few statically routed pages, I may host the examples and complete uses of my other GIT projects and a complete rebuild of this interface (The next update WILL be compatability breaking.  I'm sorry about that, but as I have learned and grown, I found many better ways to do what I do in the interface, as well as continue work on the new socket transfer layer to speed up requests significantly).  The current version of the interface will likely be the last singleton version of the interface I make, and it will, as always, remain free to use in whatever way, shape or form you see fit as long as it abides by Twitch's ToS.  I'm not responsible for anything beyond providing the abstraction layer for you to query the API.  Lastly, the dev buildout of the new interface will likely involve proper composer and PSR-4 autoloading support to come in line with Packagist so it can be officially listed under IBurn36360/Twitch-Interface for you composer users out there.
Thank you guys for the starts, fork and even the PR I got.  It means a lot that people actually use this on and off. - Anthony "IBurn36360" Diaz

For any information about the interface, please look in the module list below (Yes, I know PHP does not actually have a module system, it is just easier to sort them by this).

# Advantages

1. Encompass all currently documented API endpoints available in [Twitch's kraken V3](https://github.com/justintv/Twitch-API/tree/master/v3_resources)
2. Very simple calls: <code>$editors = $interface->getEditors('test_channel_1', -1, 0, 'Your OAuth Token', 'Your Access Code');</code>
3. Able to grab theoretically unlimited information
4. Automatically adds your client-id into the header of every call to avoid rate limits (Don't abuse twitch though, they still reserve the right to rate limit you or even deny your application access.  I take no responsibility for any actions Twitch may or may not take in order to stop abuse of the API)
5. Automatically uses a defined certificate for true HTTPS (Has a workaround in case a certificate is not provided to allow calls to go through properly)
6. Extremely configurable (See [configuration](https://github.com/IBurn36360/Twitch_Interface/blob/master/configuration.md))
7. Very light weight both in CPU usage and in memory usage (Developed with a single core system in mind [My machine is single core])
8. Easy to use returns (Everything is either an array or a bool for ease of use for novice and starting developers)
9. Checks on all authenticated calls (Will go as far as to validate that a token has the required scope for the call before attempting it)
10. Complete function walkthrough output and error output (See [Output](https://github.com/IBurn36360/Twitch_Interface/blob/master/Modules/output.md))
11. Built on base calls for dependencies (cURL and JSON Utilities), allowing base versions to be used.
12. Easy to [install](https://github.com/IBurn36360/Twitch_Interface/blob/master/installation.md)
